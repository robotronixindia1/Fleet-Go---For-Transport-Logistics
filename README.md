# Fleet-Go---For-Transport-Logistics
This project involved building a robust web portal with real-time fleet monitoring and dynamic dashboards using ReactJS. A modular backend was developed with Spring Boot and Node.js, supported by Kafka for real-time data streaming. PostgreSQL and InfluxDB were used for transactional and time-series data, while GCS, BigQuery, and GraphQL enabled scalable big data analytics. Role-specific dashboards and secure access control were implemented to enhance usability. Cross-functional collaboration ensured smooth deployment and maintenance. The system achieved a 35% increase in user satisfaction and a 40% improvement in data handling speed. The architecture is designed for scalability and high performance under heavy data loads.![fleet go 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/899ee550-d8b6-4a09-a883-6dd68cc5e3c0)
